# Small-JS-Practice-Things
A collection of smaller projects looped into one repository to improve my JavaScript skills! :)
The goal of this repo is to help me get more practice and comfortable as I possibly can with JavaScript! I will practice various things, and leave a breakdown of each project with what I learned, what I could work on, and the like.
